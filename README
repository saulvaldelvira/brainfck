Brainfck
========

Brainfuck interpreter

== Features
- std: (default: on)
- alloc: (default: on)

brainfck can be used without std, and even without alloc!
Just in case you need to run some brainfuck code on embeded devices ;)

NOTE: Without alloc, the interpreter can only execute programs with a
limited ammount of memory and instructions, and will panic if it reaches
its limit.

== Documentation ==
To read the library documentation run `cargo doc`
or browse the online docs at https://docs.rs/brainfck
